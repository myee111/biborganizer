# Vertex AI Configuration
# Required: Your Google Cloud Project ID
VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id

# Optional: Vertex AI region (default: us-central1)
VERTEX_REGION=us-central1

# Optional: Claude model to use (default: claude-3-5-sonnet@20240620)
# Available models:
#   - claude-3-5-sonnet@20240620 (recommended)
#   - claude-3-opus@20240229
#   - claude-3-5-haiku@20241022
CLAUDE_MODEL=claude-3-5-sonnet@20240620

# Optional: Confidence threshold for clustering (default: 0.5)
# Range: 0.0 (very loose - groups more) to 1.0 (very strict - groups less)
# Recommended values:
#   0.3-0.4 = Very loose grouping (many photos per cluster)
#   0.5-0.6 = Balanced grouping (recommended for helmet/outfit matching)
#   0.7-0.8 = Strict grouping (fewer photos per cluster)
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.5

# Timestamp-based clustering configuration (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
# Time windows for automatic photo clustering based on shot date

# TIMESTAMP_EXACT_MATCH_SECONDS (default: 10)
# Photos within this many seconds → AUTOMATIC MATCH (1.0)
# Treats photos as guaranteed same person (burst photography)
# Recommended values:
#   5-10 = Tight grouping (only rapid burst shots)
#   10-15 = Balanced (typical burst mode)
#   15-30 = Loose (sequential shots through gates)
TIMESTAMP_EXACT_MATCH_SECONDS=10

# TIMESTAMP_HIGH_PRIORITY_SECONDS (default: 30)
# Photos within this many seconds → HIGH PRIORITY (0.85 minimum)
# Still uses visual comparison but strongly biased to match
# Recommended values:
#   20-30 = Tight (sequential shots only)
#   30-60 = Balanced (same racer, different angles)
#   60-120 = Loose (same racer over longer sequence)
TIMESTAMP_HIGH_PRIORITY_SECONDS=30

# Note: EXACT_MATCH must be ≤ HIGH_PRIORITY
# Shot Date is extracted from EXIF DateTimeOriginal or macOS kMDItemContentCreationDate
# Visual similarity is used when timestamps are beyond HIGH_PRIORITY window or missing
